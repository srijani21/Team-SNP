Subtheme: Inclusive Education 
Team : Team SNP
Problem Statement : How might we develop a PLATFORM for STUDENTS to UNDERSTANDING CONCEPTS IN A BETTER WAY RATHER THAN MUGGING IT UP
Solution : Our web based platform will focus on engaged learning from KG to 12th for normal students and specially abled people. We have divided the standards to 2 sections - KG to 5th and 6th to 12th. From KG to 5th , the answer to the questions will be in a storytelling format in a basic level, and from 6th to 12th, the storytelling will be in a higher level. 
Ideathons, Hackathons, giveaways, virtual maker spaces are also included in the solution. For specially abled people, we have a separate icon in the home page for enabling them to learn. 
Future developments: For specially abled people, there is a separate webpage which focusses on ADHD, visually impaired with voice overs, for deaf and dumb, through sign language through cartoon characters
impact to be created : To even enable specially abled people to enjoy education.
